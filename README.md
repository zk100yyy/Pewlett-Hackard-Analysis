# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## 1.Overview of the analysis

Bobby needed help to perform an analysis he was tasked with: future-proofing the company by determining how many people will be retiring and which employees will be eligible for a retirement package. To do this analysis, I created queries to provide when each employee was hired and their age. Pewlett-Hackard is looking forward to create a mentorship to promote within company to alliviate the tsunami of retirement coming soon.

To show the accurate picture among employee, manager, and departments information, I have created a logical diagram as visuals.

Below is the specifics.
